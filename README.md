# Introduction
This repository stores the group coursework for year 2 Software Design & Implementation module. This contains the code for the specified TrekStar program that we had to create.

# What is it?
The original outline of the program provided to us was to produce a system which stored different film projects for a film production company. The users of this piece of software should be able to log all information about a film, such as filming location, cast, box office, price, runtime and release materials such as BluRay, DVD, etc.
